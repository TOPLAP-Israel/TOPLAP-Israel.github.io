TOPLAP Israel and TAMI are collaborating to create an exciting food hacking and algorithmic music night with a very special
guest. Violent Emre is a young live coder from Turkey who will be touring in Israel for 2 weeks towards the end of March 2020.

Working primarily with Tidal Cycles, he creates dark break beat atmospheres with expressive sound design, creating a dark but yet inspiring soundscape and beats.

For this special evening, Emre will be collaborating with Earth To Abigail for some live coding madness using Tidals as well as Sonic Pi.

Visuals for the show will be generated live by Eyal Gruss.

TAMI will be inaugurating it's new food hacking initiative by cooking goodies for everyone attending the event!
