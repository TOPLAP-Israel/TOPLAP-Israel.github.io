>Algorave is made from “sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive conditionals“. These days just about all electronic music is made using software, but with artificial barriers between the people creating the software algorithms and the people making the music. Using systems built for creating algorithmic music and visuals, such as IXI Lang, puredata, Max/MSP, SuperCollider, Extempore, Fluxus, TidalCycles, Gibber, Sonic Pi, FoxDot and Cyril these barriers are broken down, and musicians are able to compose and work live with their music as algorithms. This has good and bad sides, but a different approach leads to interesting places. - [Algorave official website](https://algorave.com/about/)

Inspired by Ted Nelson's ideologies exposed in his dual-book _Computer Lib / Dream Machines_, this Algorave
movement's first edition in Israel aspires to celebrate the creative power of code and technology through music,
dance and visuals. We want to go back to a time where dreams of what the World could become through the power of
technology were alive and thriving. A time where visionaries imagined a fascinating world without borders to
creativity and learning.
