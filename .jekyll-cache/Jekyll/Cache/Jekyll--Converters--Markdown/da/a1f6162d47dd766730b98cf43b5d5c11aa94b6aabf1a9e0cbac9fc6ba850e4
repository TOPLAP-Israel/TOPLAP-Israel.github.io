<p>From the <a href="https://algorave.com/about/">Algorave official website</a>:</p>

<p>‚ÄúAlgorave is made from ‚Äúsounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive
conditionals‚Äú. These days just about all electronic music is made using software, but with artificial barriers
between the people creating the software algorithms and the people making the music. Using systems built for
creating algorithmic music and visuals, such as IXI Lang, puredata, Max/MSP, SuperCollider, Extempore, Fluxus,
TidalCycles, Gibber, Sonic Pi, FoxDot and Cyril these barriers are broken down, and musicians are able to
compose and work live with their music as algorithms. This has good and bad sides, but a different approach
leads to interesting places.‚Äù</p>

<p>Uniting both visual and sound artists, ‚ÄúDream Machines‚Äù is a celebration of our passion for code. We celebrate code
not only for the possibilities it can open but also because of the sense of magic it can create when used as a form
of human artistic expression.</p>

<p>Inspired by Ted Nelson‚Äôs ideologies exposed in his dual-book <em>Computer Lib / Dream Machines</em>, the first edition of
an Algorave in Israel aspires to celebrate the creative power of code and technology through music,
dance and visuals. We want to go back to a time where dreams of what the World could become through the power of
technology were alive and thriving. A time where visionaries imagined a fascinating world without borders to
creativity and learning supported by the help of computers.</p>
